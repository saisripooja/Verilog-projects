# Verilog Projects üöÄ

Welcome to **Verilog Projects**, a collection of digital designs stubbornly hacked together in Verilog HDL by [Sai Sri Pooja](https://github.com/saisripooja).  
If you're looking for clean code... well, at least it's clean **enough to simulate**. ü´°

## üí° About

This repo is where digital dreams and HDL nightmares collide.  
You'll find a variety of Verilog modules, FSMs, arithmetic units, and random flashes of "why did I even think this would work on first try?"  
Perfect for practicing HDL coding, simulation skills, and anger management after 100+ syntax errors.

## üõ†Ô∏è Projects List

| Project Name            | Description                                                   |
|--------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| Calculator FSM           | FSM-based calculator performing basic operations like ADD, SUB, MUL, DIV, etc. |
| 4-bit Up-Down Counter    | A synchronous 4-bit counter that can count up and down.        |
| Single Port RAM          | A simple single-port RAM design.                              |
| MUX Designs              | Different multiplexer implementations (Because why not?)      |
| ALU Project              | Basic Arithmetic Logic Unit design.                           |
| D Flip-Flop              | Because you gotta start somewhere.                            |
| Router Design            | Packet router with basic functionality.                       |
| Dividers                 | Division circuits that almost made me divide my sanity.        |
| Dual Port RAM            | Access from two ports ‚Äî because life‚Äôs too short for one.      |
| FIFO Design              | First In First Out, just like my patience with bugs.           |
| PWM Generator            | Pulse Width Modulator ‚Äî yes, it pulses.                       |
| Sequence Detector        | Detects sequences ‚Äî like how I detect late project deadlines. |
| Seven Segment Controller | Because displaying numbers never gets old.                    |
| SPI Protocol             | Serial Peripheral Interface, not "Some Painful Interface".    |
| Traffic Light Controller | Classic beginner project. Still crashed only once!             |
| UART Communication       | Universal Asynchronous Receiver Transmitter. Fancy, right?     |
| Vending Machine FSM      | FSM to simulate vending machine logic (sadly no free snacks).  |
