# Verilog Projects 🚀

Welcome to **Verilog Projects**, a collection of digital designs stubbornly hacked together in Verilog HDL by [Sai Sri Pooja](https://github.com/saisripooja).  
If you're looking for clean code... well, at least it's clean **enough to simulate**. 🫡

## 💡 About

This repo is where digital dreams and HDL nightmares collide.  
You'll find a variety of Verilog modules, FSMs, arithmetic units, and random flashes of "why did I even think this would work on first try?"  
Perfect for practicing HDL coding, simulation skills, and anger management after 100+ syntax errors.

## 🛠️ Projects List

| Project Name            | Description                                                   |
|--------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| Calculator FSM           | FSM-based calculator performing basic operations like ADD, SUB, MUL, DIV, etc. |
| 4-bit Up-Down Counter    | A synchronous 4-bit counter that can count up and down.        |
| Single Port RAM          | A simple single-port RAM design.                              |
| MUX Designs              | Different multiplexer implementations (Because why not?)      |
| ALU Project              | Basic Arithmetic Logic Unit design.                           |
| D Flip-Flop              | Because you gotta start somewhere.                            |
| Router Design            | Packet router with basic functionality.                       |
| Dividers                 | Division circuits that almost made me divide my sanity.        |
| Dual Port RAM            | Access from two ports — because life’s too short for one.      |
| FIFO Design              | First In First Out, just like my patience with bugs.           |
| PWM Generator            | Pulse Width Modulator — yes, it pulses.                       |
| Sequence Detector        | Detects sequences — like how I detect late project deadlines. |
| Seven Segment Controller | Because displaying numbers never gets old.                    |
| SPI Protocol             | Serial Peripheral Interface, not "Some Painful Interface".    |
| Traffic Light Controller | Classic beginner project. Still crashed only once!             |
| UART Communication       | Universal Asynchronous Receiver Transmitter. Fancy, right?     |
| Vending Machine FSM      | FSM to simulate vending machine logic (sadly no free snacks).  |

##📋 Requirements  
---
Basic Verilog knowledge (seriously, at least Google what always @* means before you embarrass yourself).  
Verilog simulator (ModelSim, Vivado, or if you're feeling lucky: any online simulator).  

---

##🏃 How to Run  
---

Pick a project that calls to your soul (or whatever’s left of it after debugging).  
Open the .v (Verilog module) and .tb.v (testbench) files in your favorite Verilog simulator.  
Run simulations using the provided testbenches. (Trust me, they exist — I didn’t suffer for nothing.)  
Debug when (not if) you see warnings.  
Repeat until "no errors" feels better than caffeine.  

##✍️ Contributing  
---

Feel free to fork, improve, or roast these projects — contributions are highly welcome.  
Raise an issue or pull request if you spot bugs... or just want to flex your HDL skills.  
If you can make the code better, DO IT. Don't just sit there judging silently like a disappointed lab instructor.
